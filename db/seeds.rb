  bio: "I have been working in the software and game industry for more than 6 years and have passion for creating all types of games including serious, casual and AAA games. I received the 1st class Honor Degree in Computer Games Development from University of Central Lancashire, UK in 2008 and started working as a game programmer at CodeMonkey studio for a year. Before joining to my current position at NTU, I’ve been working on my own game projects while learning new game engine technologies such as UDK, Unity3D and got a lot of experience with these engines.

I also have experience in MMO game development with server-side programming using Photon Socket Server. I am specilised in using Unity3D with Photon server to make Massively Multiplayer Games. I got scripting and level design knowlege of CryEngine2 as we’ve developed an MMO world for Bluemars which is a 3D social networking MMO environment (like SecondLife) which uses CryEngine to provide realistics environments.

I had worked on the various game titles using different frameworks and commercial engines including but not limited to Unity3D, UDK, XNA framework and some in-house game engines for different platforms including PC, Mac, Xbox, Nintendo DS and iOS. I am now expanding my knowledge on developing games for other platforms such as Android, Windows Phone 7 and Bada.

Currently, I am doing my own Singapore based Start-Ups company where I mainly involve in creating contents not limited to Games, Mobile Applications development, SDKs creation for our own inhouse cloud based backend solutions.",
